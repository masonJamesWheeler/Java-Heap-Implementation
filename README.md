# Java-Heap-Implementation
My own implementation of an efficient Java heap. 

My first attempt at writing my own hashing method to store data efficently in a heap.
Adjustable parameters are used so you can maximize efficiency of the heap depending on usecase.

Parameters include:
  DEFAULT_RESIZING_LOAD_FACTOR_THRESHOLD
  DEFAULT_INITIAL_CHAIN_COUNT
  DEFAULT_INITIAL_CHAIN_CAPACITY
  
  Future progress to be made would be in finding ways for program to adjust these values dynamically based
  on what the most efficient theoretical values would be
